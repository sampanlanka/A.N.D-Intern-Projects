# Heart Disease and Used Car Price Prediction

This repository houses two distinct projects:

## Heart Disease Prediction (Major Project)

### Description
This project tackles the crucial task of predicting heart disease risk. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to develop a model that can analyze patient data and provide insights into their susceptibility to cardiovascular issues. Early detection and preventive measures play a vital role in managing heart health, and this project seeks to contribute to that effort.

### Technologies
- Python
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow

### Dataset
The heart disease data is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

### Model Performance
The accuracy of the model is around 87%.

## Used Car Price Prediction (Minor Project)

### Description
This project focuses on predicting the fair market value of used cars. By analyzing factors like make, model, year, mileage, condition, features, and market trends, we aim to build a model that can estimate prices accurately. This can benefit both buyers and sellers when navigating the used car market.

### Technologies
scikit-learn (for tasks like regression and data preprocessing)
TensorFlow or PyTorch (if you're exploring deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural networks for image-based features)
Pandas and Matplotlib (for data analysis and visualization)

### Dataset
The used car data is sourced from Kaggle.

### Model Performance
The accuracy of the model is around 70%.
